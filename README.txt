Hi!

So this is a very early version. Not ready for prime time.
But if you are so interested as to jump into sharks just to
be able to get your greasy fingertips all over your shiny
new 24 inch HD LCD monitor setup, this file may guide you in
the epic journey of doing so.

So the first part is getting stuff from SVN, which I figure 
you have already done so, or you are using that text browser
on Google Code and then you are lame. So the first thing you 
need to do is to svn checkout and get a local copy of this
folder.

After that, you need to make sure your webcam works. Actually
this should be step -1, because there's no way for it to work
if it doesn't work. Make sure it works somewhere.

If you run Windows, you can try using the OpenCV version or
you can install VideoCapture and set input_type (found in
shinytouch.py) to "videocapture" to use that as the input.

You need OpenCV or VideoCapture, PIL and pyGame.
