Detecting the reflection of a finger is the key innovation in ShinyTouch that allows it to capture the position and depth of the finger with one camera.

The prototype reference implementation of the concept implements several detectors for the reflection.

  * RGB Color Range - this is the simplest, most primitive, provides semi-decent results but requires extensive manual calibration
  * Variable Color Range - the above with a color range that changes based on the horizontal location, also primitive, not that good and requires even more manual calibration
  * Color Ratios - This is the beginning of the "modern" shinytouch. It uses 3 points, from the target (finger), reflection (well, potential reflection), and background (a few pixels above the finger). it uses a fixed ratio to mix BG with Target and compares that to the color of the reflection.
  * Reverse Color Ratio - Calculate the color ratio from the BG, Target and Reflection and see if it fits the range
